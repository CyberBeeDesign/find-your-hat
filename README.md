# Find your hat

## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### 1
In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game with JavaScript classes. Because the goal involves user input, make sure you read the guide on working with user input in Node.js. If you complete this project on our platform, you can test and run your code with the command node main.js in the terminal.
